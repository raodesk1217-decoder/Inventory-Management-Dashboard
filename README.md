# 📊 Inventory Management Dashboard using SQL & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a complete Inventory Management System using SQL for database design and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.

The objective of this project is to track stock levels, monitor inventory movements, analyze supplier performance, and provide real-time insights for better decision-making.

This project simulates a real-world business scenario where inventory data is stored in a relational database and transformed into meaningful insights through a dashboard.

## 🗂️ Database Design

The database was created using SQL with proper relational structure.

### Tables Used:

- **SKU_Master** → Stores product details  
- **Supplier_Master** → Stores supplier information  
- **Inventory_Transactions** → Tracks stock movement (inward & outward)  
- **External_Stock** → External stock details  

### Database Features:

- Primary and Foreign Key relationships  
- Structured schema design  
- Data normalization  
- Query-based data transformation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- MySQL (Database Creation & Queries)
- Power BI (Dashboard Visualization)
- Excel (Initial Data Preparation)
- GitHub (Project Version Control)

## 📊 Key Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides insights such as:

- ✅ Total Stock Quantity
- ✅ Inward vs Outward Stock Movement
- ✅ Supplier-wise Inventory Distribution
- ✅ SKU-wise Stock Availability
- ✅ Inventory Trends Analysis
- ✅ Stock Monitoring by Category

This helps in identifying low stock levels, supplier performance, and overall inventory efficiency.
